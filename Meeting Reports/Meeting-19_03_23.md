# Second meeting
## Game main menu 
Main menu is build like the candy crush or like pokemon level menu. 
(The road will be the uni. We will only create the main menu once the games are done. This should be around in the second sprint.) 
Before going to the next floor the player is asked a question and depending of the outcome (correct wrong) the player will recive
ETCs that will allow him to go futher in the univeristy. 
Will be used for computers only for better user input. 
## Games to add 
- Tetris 
- space invaders 
- pacman
- (Pong)

## Main menu / NPCS (NPC = Non Player Character)
We had the idea to create a world which is based in the Maison du Savoir with the different floors and rooms. In the different lecture rooms the main character enters in a quiz mode vs a professor NPC which asks a question. By answering it correctly the player can collect different ECTS. Also during the game the player can talk to different NPCS so he knows what to do during the game or has a book which gives hints. 
With the ECTS collection he can have access to the minigames and even have bonus packs. 

The Graphics will be based as in a Pokemon game on Gameboy Color. And a fight would be like between two Pokemons but with a question between the Professor NPC and a player as in the powerpoint file of the second meeting. 

## SOUNDS / LEADERBOARD / SETTINGS
For the sounds we will use pixabay, which gives us the possibility to have different free sounds for our movements, interactions, and different situations during the game.

By completing the game you can achieve a position in a leaderboard which is based on playing time. This means the fastest player that finishes the game gets the first place on the leaderboard. 

We also talked about to implement a settings board, so we can turn of the volume or even have a progressbar for it. 
By being in the settings board the timer of the time get's paused so no mistake will be created for the leaderboard.
With a resume button the game can be continued. 

## Tools 
Unity with JS and C#. The questions will be saved in a JSON File format.
We will be using Trello for progress taracking. 
And will be using SonarLint for code smells and other errors.
