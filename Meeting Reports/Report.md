# First meeting

## Ideas

 - teaching about BINFO in a style of solorean.com
 - memory style game regarding BINFO
 - general style quiz of BINFO
 - maze game where hitting walls lead to questions regarding BINFO
 - pacman where fruits have binfo questions regarding BINFO
 - using retro games to promote BINFO
 - jeopardy BINFO quiz


## After Brainstorming
 We came up with an idea of combining all of above mentioned ideas into one project. We would like to create a game with multiple levels (3 - 5) and on each level the person playing the game completes a retro style game with questions about BINFO included in them in a creative way.
