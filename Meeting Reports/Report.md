# First meeting

## Ideas

 - Teaching about BINFO in a style of solorean.com
 - Memory style game regarding BINFO
 - General style quiz of BINFO
 - Maze game where hitting walls lead to questions regarding BINFO
 - Pac-Man where fruits have questions regarding BINFO
 - Using retro games to promote BINFO
 - Jeopardy BINFO quiz


## After Brainstorming
 We came up with an idea of combining all of above mentioned ideas into one project. We would like to create a game with multiple levels (3 - 5) and on each level the person playing the game completes a retro style game with questions about BINFO included in them in a creative way.
