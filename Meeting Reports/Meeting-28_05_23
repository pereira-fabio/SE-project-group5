# Sixth Meeting

In this meeting we talked about how we can finalize our project. We had some troubles putting the different games together because of small bugs that came up. 

## Goals: 
- Bug Fixes of Space Invaders and Pac-Man
- Implementation of different games
- Final Boss
- GameOverPanel in every scenario
- Resume Panel in every scenario
- Audio fixes
- ECTS implementation

## Conclusion
We changed different things inside the game, it's manageable to do but the game could be improved in some aspects. The game will be finished but different features could be added if we had more time. (Example: Scoreboard)
The game is now more a clicker game than an rpg. We have managed to do most of the tasks and get rid of most of the bugs.
