### Final outlook of the game
Player (P1) is spawned in the MSA and has to through 3 floors to get out of the building.
When spawned first NPC briefly explains what P1 needs to do in order to get out of the
building. On each floor player goes through a number of rooms in which other NPC's ask 
questions about the BINFO for correct answers P1 collects ECTS points. After going through 
the floor the player is presented with the minigame (Based on the amount of ECTS the minigames 
between the levels become harder or easier). When exitig the building the player has a fight 
in which he uses ects to kill the boss. After finishig the game the scoreboard is presented.
