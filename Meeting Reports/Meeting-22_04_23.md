# Fifth Meeting
## Objectives For the 31.
 - GameOver screen for every mini game
 - Implementing the Quiz 
 - ECTs counter for each correct guessed question and completed game.
 - Final Boss

## Conclusion
After the meeting we descided to make some cuts, as it would have taken a lot of time finishing it and also with the issues we had with the merge of the mini games to the main game. We choose to keep it simple as it might have lead to more unwanted issues. 
We wanted to make the game a bit more complet, therefore we choose to add a final boss.
