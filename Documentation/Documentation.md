## Initial Ideas That We Kept

Our primary goal was to create an educational and entertaining game that would allow players to learn while having fun. To achieve this, we decided to develop a game with mini-games that would require players to apply their knowledge in various subjects.

One of the ideas we kept was to incorporate retro games into our game. We believed that adding familiar and nostalgic games would engage players and create an enjoyable gaming experience. Additionally, we introduced a quiz component where players could earn points for each correctly answered question, reinforcing the learning aspect of the game.

Initially, we also planned to include a multi-layered game structure where players could explore different floors of the university campus. However, due to time constraints and the complexity involved, we had to abandon this idea. We faced challenges during the merging of the mini-games into the main game, which required significant time and effort to resolve. As a result, we decided to prioritize the stability of the game and focus on the mini-games and the final boss battle.

Since the beginning, we had the concept of a final boss battle in mind. To implement this, we incorporated a turn-based game similar to the mechanics of Pokemon, adding an exciting climax to the game.

## Tools Used

During the initial stages, we started using Trello as our project management tool. However, as we became less familiar with it and found it more convenient to communicate through Discord, which is similar to Slack, we gradually stopped using Trello. Discord provided a more efficient means of communication and collaboration for our team.

For programming the mini-games, we chose Unity as our development platform for several reasons. Unity offered cross-platform compatibility, allowing us to create games for various platforms such as PC, consoles, and mobile devices. Its user-friendly interface, extensive community support, and abundance of tutorials made it the ideal choice for our project.

## Role Distribution

Throughout the project, we maintained an open approach to role distribution, allowing team members to choose their tasks based on their interests and skills. During the first sprint, we assigned mini-games to different team members to ensure each person completed at least one mini-game. Piotr took charge of Pac-Man, Diogo worked on Space Invaders, and Fabio developed Tetris. This distribution was successful, with everyone completing their assigned mini-game within the first sprint.

In the second sprint, due to the challenges encountered during the merging process, we had to be more selective with role distribution. We regrouped tasks and assigned roles based on team members' capabilities and availability. The Meeting Report from April 30th, 2023, titled "Meeting-30_04_23.md," provides details on how we reallocated tasks and distributed roles.

However, due to some unforeseen circumstances, there were some late changes in role assignments. Some team members took on additional roles to ensure the project's progress was not hindered by dependencies on others to complete their tasks. These adjustments were made to maintain the project's momentum and timely completion.

Despite the challenges we faced, our team remained adaptable and committed to delivering a game that successfully combined education and entertainment.
